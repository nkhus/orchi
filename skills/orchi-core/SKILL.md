description: "The Orchi workflow every pool session follows: research, agree scope with the user, and execute Tasks, Epics, or Initiatives through Git branches and GitHub Issues. Use in Orchi's pool sessions, for implementation requests (which go to Orchi through /orchi), and for project documentation search."

# Orchi

Orchi is a development convention. Git stores code and documentation; GitHub Issues store ownership, hierarchy,
dependencies, and status. There is no controller, state database, approval receipt, or mandatory command facade.

The user types only `/orchi`: Orchi routes every request to a crew of its session pool, and crews give repository
work to their workers. A session that is none of these answers questions and documentation lookups only; for
anything to plan, build, or change it tells the user to bring it to Orchi with `/orchi`. Identify your role (Orchi,
a crew, a worker, or a reader), inspect branch and worktree changes, read the relevant issue and PR, and resume
existing work instead of duplicating it. Repository instructions (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, scoped files) take
precedence. Preserve the user's request, decisions, and edits.

## Research, propose, agree

Before choosing a delivery scope, read the relevant code, documentation, and issues, scaled to uncertainty; ask
focused questions when missing context would change the result ([clarify](references/planning.md#clarify-with-the-user)).
Present findings and options in product terms with a recommended outcome and scope; an idea that needs strategic
decisions first is [explored](references/exploration.md).

The user owns the concept, the vision, and the design; agents own everything technical. Ask the user about purpose,
users, what they see and do, priorities, design directions, constraints only they know, and what needs their
authority (merging into main, deploying, access, credentials, money). Decide the rest and record why; when it
changes what the user gets, its cost, or its timing, ask about that consequence, never the mechanism.

Agree the direction with the user before creating branches, Issues, or changes; exploring a problem or silence is
not agreement, and a pool's [autonomy level](references/pool.md#modes-and-autonomy) can delegate it. Do not re-ask
agreed direction; if new evidence changes the outcome or scale, explain and agree again.

## Scope

| Request | Tracking | Branch and PR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Question | None | None |
| Idea that needs research and strategic decisions | Exploration Issue | `explore/<slug>` for its working documents; throwaway `prototype/<slug>` branches |
| Small fix | Standalone Task | `fix/<slug>` from main, PR to main |
| Outcome decomposed into Tasks | Epic → Tasks | One `epic/<tag>-<slug>` branch and PR to main |
| Outcome decomposed into Epics | Initiative → Epics → Tasks | `initiative/<tag>-<slug>` from main; one `epic/<tag>-<epic-tag>-<slug>` PR per Epic into it; final PR to main |

Start titles with their Initiative and Epic tags, for example `[PAY][TOKEN] Add token column` ([titles and tags](references/github.md#titles-and-tags));
labels carry the type. Reuse a branch recorded in the issue. Create an Initiative branch after agreement, before its
plan or code, from the fetched remote target; never reset another checkout. Do not create placeholder parents.

## Core rules

- Parallel work happens across independent Epics, each with its own owner, branch, and worktree. Tasks within an
  Epic share its branch and PR and run in sequence, except a pool dev lead's Tasks on different files (see the pool
  reference).
- Claim before editing and never overwrite another owner's claim. Only ready Epics and standalone Tasks are
  independent entry points.
- Update documentation with the code, in the same branch. Never present planned behavior as current behavior.
- Show each new test failing before the change, and record checks, outcomes, and the candidate commit in the PR.
  Review each standalone Task and each assembled Epic once, then repair demonstrated blockers with a targeted
  follow-up.
- Squash-merge. Close Epics, Initiatives, and standalone Tasks only after confirming the merge; close Epic Tasks as
  the execution reference says. Do not infer merge or deployment permission from permission to implement.
- Where `ENGINEERING.md` exists, its checks are the code review: run them, and never weaken one without recording
  an exception there ([standards](references/standards.md#gate-integrity)).
- If GitHub is unavailable, say so; never claim remote tracking or ownership that does not exist.

## Stage guidance

Read only the reference needed for the current stage.

| Stage | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Explore and shape an idea before any scope | [Exploration](references/exploration.md) |
| Clarify with the user, design, and write Issues for agents | [Planning](references/planning.md) |
| Check that a Task or Epic is ready to start or delegate | [Readiness](references/readiness.md) |
| Find ready work, claim, execute, hand off, resume | [Execution](references/execution.md) |
| Plan, write, or review tests; diagnose a defect | [Testing](references/testing.md) |
| Set, audit, or follow a project's engineering standards (`ENGINEERING.md`) | [Standards](references/standards.md) |
| Review, integrate, and close | [Review and delivery](references/review-delivery.md) |
| Keep documentation and decisions current; working documents; reconcile branches | [Knowledge](references/knowledge.md) |
| Create, relate, or close Issues; PR conventions | [GitHub conventions](references/github.md) |
| Search or read documentation; validate links | [Retrieval](references/retrieval.md) |
| Run Orchi, crews, and workers as a session pool | [Pool](references/pool.md) |

## Entry skills and subagents

`orchi` is the entry the user types. Crews run `orchi-explore` (idea → Exploration), `orchi-plan` (request → ready
Issues), `orchi-standards` (foundation or standards Epic), `orchi-design` (design Epic → PR), and `orchi-deliver`
(Issue → PR); workers run `orchi-work`. They are hidden from the menu. Sessions may delegate to the subagents in
[roles](roles/README.md): `orchi-scout` retrieves, `orchi-researcher` researches and designs options for an
exploration, `orchi-implementer` executes one ready Task, `orchi-fixer` makes one small, fully specified change (a
simple Task or a confirmed defect repair), `orchi-designer` executes one ready UI Task or audits a UI diff with
Impeccable, and `orchi-reviewer` reviews. Subagents never talk to the user, change Issues, push, or merge; their
reports are claims to verify. Delegation is optional; the readiness checklists are not.

## Tools

The scripts are read-only (Git, `gh`, Python standard library); run them from the repository root, using this
skill's base directory in a user-wide install. `python3 .claude/skills/orchi-core/scripts/status.py` lists open
Epics and standalone Tasks with owners, blockers, and readiness; `knowledge.py` searches documentation, reads exact
snapshots, and checks local links; `standards.py` checks `ENGINEERING.md` against CI.
